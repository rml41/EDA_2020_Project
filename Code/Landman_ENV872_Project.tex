\section{Rationale and Research
Questions}\label{rationale-and-research-questions}}

Ellerbe Creek runs into the Falls Lake Resovoir, through the city of
Durham, North Carolina. Falls Lake serves as the source of drinking
water for the City of Raleigh and does not meet North Carolina standards
for \emph{chlorophyll a}, which is found in algae (SOURCE:
\url{https://durhamnc.gov/716/Falls-Lake}). Algal blooms generally come
from excess nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen. Ellerbe Creek is
one of the sources of excess nutrients and contaminents in Falls Lake.
The Ellerbe Creek Watershed has the highest population density of
Durham's watersheds, with an estimated 22\% impervious surface (SOURCE:
\url{https://files.nc.gov/ncdeq/Water\%20Quality/Planning/BPU/BPU/Neuse/Neuse\%20Plans/2009\%20Plan/Chapter\%201.pdf}).
It is impacted by both point and nonpoint sources and was found to
deliver the highest nutrient loads to Falls Lake (SOURCE:
\url{https://files.nc.gov/ncdeq/Water\%20Quality/Planning/BPU/BPU/Neuse/Neuse\%20Plans/2009\%20Plan/Chapter\%201.pdf}).
Ellerbe Creek and Falls Lake are both on the state's impaired water
bodies list (303(d) list) (SOURCE
\url{https://durhamnc.gov/711/Ellerbe-Creek-Watershed},
\url{https://www.usgs.gov/centers/sa-water/science/groundwatersurface-water-interaction-near-ellerbe-creek-durham-nc?qt-science_center_objects=0\#qt-science_center_objects}).
Ellerbe Creek was first listed on the 303(d) list in 1998 (SOURCE:
\url{https://files.nc.gov/ncdeq/Water\%20Quality/Planning/BPU/BPU/Neuse/Neuse\%20Plans/2009\%20Plan/Chapter\%201.pdf})

This analysis and report will aim to answer the following questions: 1.
Are Nitrogen and Phosphorus levels in Ellerbe Creek above recommended
levels? 2. Is there a relationship between flow and Nitrogen or
Phosphorus levels? 3. How does location, upstream vs.~downstream, impact
nutrient levels?

\hypertarget{dataset-information}{%
\section{Dataset Information}\label{dataset-information}}

Nutrient data for this project were downloaded from the the Water
Quality Portal, a coorperative service sponsered by the United States
Geological Survey (USGS), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and
the National Water Quality Monitoring Council (NWQMC) on February 27,
2020. Discharge data were downloaded for two stream gages along Ellerbe
Creek, HUC code 030202010403, from USGS using the data dataRetrieval
package in R. The dataset analyzed contains 21 monitoring locations with
measurments for nitrogen and phosphorus levels from 1982 to 2018 and
daily discharge data from 2008 to 20202. Not all locations had data for
each nutrient. Nitrogen and Phosphorus concentrations are recorded as
mg/L of Nitrogen or Phosphorus in various compounds including, nitrate,
nitrite, ammonia, ammonium, organic nitrogen, phosphate, and organic
phosphorus. The USGS gage locations are Club Blvd (0208675010),
upstream, and Gorman (02086849), downstream.

\subsection{Initial Exploration}\label{initial-exploration}}

Explored raw data from the water quality portal to determine potential
variables for analysis and time period of data. Examined a summary of
all the characteristics in the dataset to determine the count for each
variable. Selected Nitrogen, mixed forms (NH3), (NH4), organic, (NO2)
and (NO3) and Phosphorus as the two variables to analyze. Explored
discharge data to determine date range of data.

\subsection{Discharge Data Wrangling}\label{discharge-data-wrangling}}

Flow data from the two USGS stream gages were combined in two data sets,
one as a long format with all discharge in one column and one in wide
format, with two seperate columns for discharge based on location.

A boxplot was made to visualize the range of discharge at each site

The discharge over time at each location does not show any obvious
seasonal or annual trends.

\hypertarget{nutrient-data-wrangling}{%
\subsection{Nutrient Data Wrangling}\label{nutrient-data-wrangling}}

The nutrient data set from the water quality portal was cleans to remove
all irrelevant information and retain just characterstics of interest,
Nitrogen and Phosphorus. Nitrogen and Phosphorus values for many samples
were recorded as both mg/L of N and P, and of NO3 and PO4 respectively.
Data were downloaded in long format and were converted to wide format in
order to convert Nitrogen and Phosphorus values to mg/L of N or P.
Relevant columns such as data, location, hydrologic event, variable
name, measured value, and units were selected and processed data were
saved as both long and wide format.
