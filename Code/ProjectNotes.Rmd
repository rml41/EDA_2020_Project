## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Notes from Wrangling
```{r}
EC_Nutrients_USGS_Processed2$site_no <- as.character(EC_Nutrients_USGS_Processed2$site_no)
EllerbeDischarge_Club$site_no <- as.character(EllerbeDischarge_Club$site_no)

EC_Nutrients_Club <- full_join(EC_Nutrients_USGS_Processed2, EllerbeDischarge_Club, by = "site_no")


### need one column for site and one column for date 

EC_Discharge_bind <- rbind(EllerbeDischarge_Club, EllerbeDischarge_Gorman)
EC_Discharge_bind$Date <- as.Date(EC_Discharge_bind$Date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")

EC_Nutrients_Join <- full_join(EC_Discharge_bind, EC_Nutrients_USGS_Processed2, by = c("site_no", "Date"))
```
