## Summary

<describe the purpose of this repository, the information it contains, and any relevant analysis goals. What, why, where, when, how?>

This repository was prepared for the Environmental Data Analytics (Env 872L) at Duke Univeristy, Spring 2020 final project. 

The repository contains data from US Geological Survey and North Carolina Department of Environmental Resources. Data is from the Ellerbe Creek Watershed HUC 03020201. The purpose of it is to anaylze water quality trends along Ellerbe Creek. Specifically, analysis will focus on water quality following storm events as well as seasonal and annual trends from 1968 - 2018.

## Database Information

<describe the origin of all data in the repository, including data collected from outside sources and new data generated by the investigator(s). If data was accessed from an outside database, the date(s) of data access should also be included.>

Data were downloaded through the Water Quality Portal, a coorperative service sponsered by the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the National Water Quality Monitoring Council (NWQMC). Data was accessed on February 27, 2020. 

From the Water Quality Portal (https://www.waterqualitydata.us/portal/), the following selections were made: 
* Location 
    ** State: North Carolina
* Site Parameters
    **
    **
* Sampling Parameters

    **
* Select Data Download - Site data only
* File format - Comma-separated 

csv file was saved as `Ellerbe_WaterQuality_Raw_Data.csv`. 

Data were accessed 2019-12-13.

## Folder structure, file formats, and naming conventions 

<describe the folders contained in the repository, including what type of files they contain>

The repository contains the following folders:
Code - rmd files with code for each step of the process including Data Wrangling, Data Exploration, Data Analysis, Notes, and the final project script. Additionally, knitted PDF documents will be saved in this folder. 
Data - containing two folders, one for all raw datasets and one for all processed datasets 
Output - Folder for outputs from visualizations (pdfs)


<describe the formats of files for the various purposes contained in the repository>

All scripts are saved as .rmd documents 
All scripts will be knitted and saved as a PDF when they are finished 
Both processed and raw data are stored as csv files 
Geospatial data are stored as .shp, .dbf, and .shx files 
Outputs are stored as PDF files 

<describe your file naming conventions>

Files are named according to the following convention: 
datalocation_datatype_details_stage.format

**datalocation** refers to Ellerbe Creek

**datatype** is a description of data 

**details** are additional descriptive details, particularly important for processed data 

**stage** refers to the stage in data management pipelines (e.g., raw, cleaned, or processed)

**format** is a non-proprietary file format (e.g., .csv, .txt)

## Metadata

<For each data file in the repository, describe the data contained in each column. Include the column name, a description of the information, the class of data, and any units associated with the data. Create a list or table for each data file.> 

## Scripts and code

<list any software scripts/code contained in the repository and a description of their purpose.>
